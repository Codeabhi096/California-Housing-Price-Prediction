## 📌 Project Overview

The **California Housing Price Prediction** project is a machine learning-based solution that predicts house prices using various features like location, income, and housing characteristics. This helps buyers, sellers, and real estate companies make informed decisions based on data insights.

---

## 📊 Features

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📉 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- 📦 Model Training using Linear Regression
- 💾 Joblib model serialization
- 🖥️ Streamlit-based Web UI
- 📈 Real-time predictions using user input

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

| Category | Tools |
|---------|-------|
| Language | Python |
| Libraries | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |
| Web App | Streamlit |
| Model Deployment | joblib |
| Others | pandas-profiling, missingno, Eel, Flask, etc. |

## 💡 How It Works

* Dataset: California Housing Dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
* Features used: `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, `AveRooms`, `AveOccup`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, etc.
* Model: Trained using **Linear Regression**
* Predictions are made based on user inputs via the Streamlit form

---

## 📚 Learnings

* Hands-on with EDA using matplotlib, seaborn, missingno
* Model training & evaluation using scikit-learn
* Building and deploying ML app using Streamlit
* Creating clean code structure and UI
